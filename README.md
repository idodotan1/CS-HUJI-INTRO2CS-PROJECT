# CS-HUJI-INTRO2CS-PROJECT
This is the final project for the Introduction to Computer Science course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which I completed during Semester A of 2024.

We were given five different options for our final project, each with a set of basic requirements. Beyond these, we had the freedom to implement extensions to improve our grade. I chose the Random Walker project, which involves simulating a Random Walker system with customizable parameters, such as:
The walker's movement patterns
The number of simulations
The number of steps
The addition of obstacles
The inclusion of “magic portals”
And more...
The project allows users to analyze the simulation’s data and statistics through visualized graphs.

This was my first experience creating something independently, using only general guidelines without a predefined API. Considering this was my first programming course, I’m quite satisfied with how my project turned out.
